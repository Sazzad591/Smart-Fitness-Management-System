# Smart Fitness Management System

## Project Description

The Smart Fitness Management System (SFMS) is a Python-based desktop application built using Tkinter for the graphical user interface. It enables users to manage personal fitness goals by tracking workouts, nutrition, and progress through an intuitive interface. Data is stored in memory for simplicity, with features for user profiles, logging activities, and generating basic reports. This project demonstrates skills in GUI development, data management, and modular programming.

## Features
